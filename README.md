# API Performance Monitoring System

A system for monitoring and analyzing the performance of RESTful APIs in real-time. This tool provides insights into API latency, request failure rates, and resource usage. It integrates with Prometheus for metric collection and Grafana for visualization and alerting.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of API performance metrics
- Metrics on latency, request failure rates, and resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Integration with Prometheus for collecting metrics
- Integration with Grafana for visualizing metrics and setting up alerts
- Automated alerts when performance thresholds are exceeded

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend logic and API monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Metric collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboarding
- **Docker** (optional): For containerization

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker (if using containerization)
- Python 3.x
- Prometheus
- Grafana

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/api-performance-monitoring.git
   cd api-performance-monitoring

2. Install dependencies (if any):

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure Prometheus:

Edit the prometheus.yml file to include your API endpoints.


scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'api_monitoring'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']


4. Start Prometheus and Grafana using Docker or directly on your machine.

5. Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 and configure the dashboard to pull metrics from Prometheus.

Usage
Start your API (ensure it exposes metrics at /metrics).

Prometheus will scrape data at the configured interval.

View real-time performance metrics on the Grafana dashboard.

Set up alerts in Grafana for performance thresholds (e.g., high latency or error rates).
