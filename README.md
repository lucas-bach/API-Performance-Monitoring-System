# API Performance Monitoring System

A system for monitoring and analyzing the performance of RESTful APIs in real-time. This tool provides insights into API latency, request failure rates, and resource usage. It integrates with Prometheus for metric collection and Grafana for visualization and alerting.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of API performance metrics
- Metrics on latency, request failure rates, and resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Integration with Prometheus for collecting metrics
- Integration with Grafana for visualizing metrics and setting up alerts
- Automated alerts when performance thresholds are exceeded

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend logic and API monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Metric collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboarding
- **Docker** (optional): For containerization

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker (if using containerization)
- Python 3.x
- Prometheus
- Grafana
